        <h2>Educational Content Section</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.</p>
        <p>The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.</p>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to "learn" from large amounts of data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Tutorial: Getting Started with Python</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. Here's how to get started:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install Python from python.org</li>
            <li>Set up your development environment</li>
            <li>Learn basic syntax and data types</li>
            <li>Practice with simple projects</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Python's syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. This makes it an excellent language for beginners, yet it's powerful enough for advanced applications.</p>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Research Findings</h2>
        <p>Recent studies in cognitive science have shown that spaced repetition is one of the most effective learning techniques. By reviewing material at increasing intervals, learners can move information from short-term to long-term memory more effectively.</p>
        <p>The research indicates that students who use spaced repetition techniques retain 50% more information compared to those who use traditional cramming methods.</p>
