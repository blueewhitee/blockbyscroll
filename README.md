# ScrollStop

**Control your X/Twitter scrolling and prevent doomscrolling**

ScrollStop is a browser extension designed to help you maintain healthy scrolling habits on X (formerly Twitter) by limiting how much you can scroll in a single session.

## Features

- üìä Track your scrolling activity on sites addded to blocklist
- üõë Set custom scroll limits to prevent endless doomscrolling
-  domain-specific scroll counter that tracks scrolls separately for each website
- üì± Visual indicators showing your current scroll progress
- üîÑ Quick reset option when you need to continue browsing

## Why ScrollStop?

Social media platforms like X are designed to keep you scrolling and consuming content endlessly. This can lead to:
- Reduced productivity
- Information overload
- Mental fatigue
- Time wasted

ScrollStop helps you take control of your scrolling habits by giving you a visual indicator of how much you've scrolled and blocking further scrolling once you've reached your preset limit.

## How It Works

1. **Track Scrolling**: ScrollStop counts significant scroll actions on X/Twitter
2. **Set Limits**: You decide how many scrolls you want to allow yourself
3. **Block On Limit**: Once you reach your limit, a friendly overlay prevents further scrolling
4. **Reset When Ready**: You can choose to reset the counter and continue browsing
