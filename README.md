**Control your scrolling and prevent doomscrolling**

## Why NoMoScroll?

Social media platforms and content sites are designed to keep you scrolling and consuming content endlessly. This can lead to:
- Reduced productivity
- Information overload
- Mental fatigue
- Time wasted

NoMoScroll helps you take control of your scrolling habits by giving you a visual indicator of how much you've scrolled and blocking further scrolling once you've reached your preset limit.

## How It Works

1. **Track Scrolling**: NoMoScroll counts significant scroll actions on your chosen sites
2. **Set Limits**: You decide how many scrolls you want to allow yourself (globally or per site)
3. **Block On Limit**: Once you reach your limit, a friendly overlay prevents further scrolling
4. **Reset When Ready**: You can choose to reset the counter manually or set an automatic timer
