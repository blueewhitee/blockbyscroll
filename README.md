# ScrollStop

**Control your scrolling habits and prevent doomscrolling on distracting websites**

ScrollStop is a browser extension designed to help you maintain healthy scrolling habits on social media and other distracting websites by limiting how much you can scroll in a single session.

## Features

- üìä Track your scrolling activity on multiple sites (YouTube, X/Twitter, Reddit, and more)
- üõë Set global and site-specific scroll limits to prevent endless doomscrolling
- üì± Visual indicators showing your current scroll progress
- üîÑ Quick reset option when you need to continue browsing
- ‚è±Ô∏è Optional auto-reset timer to refresh counters automatically
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable blocklist to manage which sites are monitored

## Why ScrollStop?

Social media platforms and content sites are designed to keep you scrolling and consuming content endlessly. This can lead to:
- Reduced productivity
- Information overload
- Mental fatigue
- Time wasted

ScrollStop helps you take control of your scrolling habits by giving you a visual indicator of how much you've scrolled and blocking further scrolling once you've reached your preset limit.

## How It Works

1. **Track Scrolling**: ScrollStop counts significant scroll actions on your chosen sites
2. **Set Limits**: You decide how many scrolls you want to allow yourself (globally or per site)
3. **Block On Limit**: Once you reach your limit, a friendly overlay prevents further scrolling
4. **Reset When Ready**: You can choose to reset the counter manually or set an automatic timer
